# NCWallCustomizer
an iOS 10 - 10.2 tweak that allows the customization of the Notification Center background.
Thanks to Apple for killing my tweak but we all have to move on. 
I open sourced this tweak because of this but it also can help other people out.
If you use any of this code please credit me!
